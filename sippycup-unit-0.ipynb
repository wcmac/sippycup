    "  - a context-free grammar with semantic attachments,\n",
    "  - a chart-parsing algorithm,\n",
    "  - a linear, feature-based scoring function for ranking candidate parses,\n",
    "  - learning of scoring parameters using stochastic gradient descent, and\n",

    "Semantic parsing is a computation which takes a linguistic input and returns as output a structured, machine-readable representation of its meaning, known as the *semantic representation* (or, informally, \"the semantics\").  The semantic representation is a computational object that captures key elements of the meaning of the input and enables the machine to respond appropriately.  Depending upon the application, it can be a simple string, a tree, a nested map, an XML document, an SQL query, or a real-valued vector.  In many cases, the semantic representation can be viewed as a little program, or as a parameterized request to a backend service.\n",

    "When developing a semantic parsing system for a new domain, one of the first tasks must be to choose a good semantic representation.  After all, this representation is the target output of the system, so its design will drive many other design decisions.  We can't control the form of the linguistic inputs, but we *can* control the design of the semantic outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Actually, in some problem settings, we have to work with a downstream executor over whose request language we have no control.  For example, the executor may be an API provided by a third party, or it may be a relational database which only responds to SQL queries.  However, even in such situations, we have the opportunity to control the design of our semantic representation, by inserting into the stack an *adapter* which performs a deterministic conversion from our semantic representation into the request language of the executor.)\n",

Above all, in order to achieve a separation of concerns between the semantic parsing system and the executor, the semantic representation must be straightforwardly machine-readable by the executor.  Machine-readability means that executor can immediately understand what it needs to do, and get straight to work.  (Actually, machine-*interpretable* would be a more accurate term.  In some limited sense, any ASCII-encoded text is machine-readable, but it is usually not machine-interpretable.  But we'll stick with the standard term.)

    "These examples might give us hope that AMR can satisfy our goals for a semantic representation.  By abstracting away from certain lexical choices (\"want\" vs. \"desire\") and syntactic choices (active vs. passive), AMR canonicalizes these inputs to a common representation, and thus renders obvious their semantic equivalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as Hal Daumé III argues in a persuasive [blog post][], AMR doesn't go nearly far enough in this direction to serve as a representation over which we can reliably perform automated reasoning.  It resolves some kinds of ambiguity, but not others.  It achieves some canonicalization, but not all.  There are many kinds of semantically equivalent transformations — lexical, compositional, logical — whose AMR formulations are not obviously equivalent.  In fact, AMR seems to be a bit of a hodge-podge, reflecting some information about lexical choice, some about syntactic structure, and some about semantic content.  In many ways, it looks like a souped-up version of [semantic role labeling][].  Like SRL, AMR may be useful for some purposes, but it can't reliably be used as a vehicle for inference.  (To be fair, the creators of AMR never promised this — they have been motivated rather by the goals of machine translation.)\n",

    "(Note that if AMR *could* be used for automated reasoning, then a good AMR parser would provide a simple solution to the problem of [recognizing textual entailment][] (RTE), that is, recognizing whether one natural-language sentence can be inferred from another.  One would simply parse both sentences into AMR, and then apply an automated reasoner to check entailment.  To my knowledge, no one has demonstrated that this is possible.)\n",

    "  [recognizing textual entailment]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_entailment\n",

    "In short, my view is that AMR is not a suitable target representation for semantic parsing.  Indeed, after decades (or even centuries!) of failures, I'm skeptical of any attempt to define a universal, machine-readable semantic representation, and prefer instead to develop application-specific representations as needed."
