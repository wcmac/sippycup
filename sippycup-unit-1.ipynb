But in richer domains, with more complex grammars, it's not unusual to find tens, hundreds, or even thousands of parses for some inputs.  However, the list of candidate parses returned by `parse_input()` appears in arbitrary order.  The first parse is not necessarily the best, and the best parse is not necessarily the first.  Therefore, we'd like to have some way of ranking the candidates, so that more plausible interpretations appear earlier in the list.\n",

Because of syntactic ambiguity, there are two possible interpretations, according to whether we perform multiplication first (in accordance with the standard [order of operations][]) or addition first.  Our parser duly produces both parses, but it happens to produce the wrong parse (the one with denotation 10) first, and the right parse (with denotation 7) second.  So this example counts as a loss for the accuracy metric, which only considers the first parse.\n",

The idea is that we define a vector of [feature functions][], each of which takes a parse as input and returns as output a real number which encodes some salient characteristic of the parse.  We then define a corresponding vector of real-valued weights (one for each feature), and we compute the score for a parse as the [inner product][] of the weight vector and the feature vector.  If $p$ is a parse, $w$ is the weight vector, and $\\phi$ is the vector of feature functions, we can write this as:\n",

Note that in the standard order of operations, operators with same precedence level (such as addition and subtraction) are evaluated left-to-right.  Accordingly, the target semantics performs the addition first.  However, the parse at position 0 performs the subtraction first.  In this case, both parses yield the same denotation, so you might think that this mistake doesn't much matter.  But that's not true in general: if the example were instead \"three minus three plus two\", the denotation would depend on the order of operations.  In the [exercises](#arithmetic-exercises) at the end of this unit, we'll ask you to introduce new features to address this problem."

    "Note that, while training accuracy increased from 0.846 (11 of 13 correct) to 1.000 (all 13 correct), test accuracy remained stuck at 0.750 (3 of 4 correct).  We seem to have learned *something* from the training data, but whatever we learned did not generalize to the test data.  In fact, if we look at the learned features, we can see exactly what we learned from the training data: that '~' should take precedence over '-' (which is correct, in the sense that it accords with the standard order of operations), and that '+' should take precedence over '-' (which is not correct, in general).  The model learned these specific preferences because the two errors it was making on the training data involved these two precedence pairs.\n",

If you add the argument `print_examples=True` to `train_test()`, you can see which example we're getting wrong: it's `\"two times two plus three\"`.  In order to get this example right, we need to know that `*` should take precedence over `+`.  But none of the examples in the training data involved this precedence pair, so we haven't learned that.\n",

    "It's clear that we need larger datasets, with more training examples.

However, annotating examples with target *denotations* can often be faster, cheaper, and more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arithmetic domain illustrates this nicely.  Writing down the target semantics for `\"minus three minus two\"` (namely, `('-', ('~', 3), 2)`) is a tedious chore that most people probably could not perform reliably.  You need to understand Lisp-y prefix notation.  You need to remember to use the funny `'~'`, instead of the more natural `'-'`, for unary `\"minus\"`.  You need to remember to quote the operators.  And you need to get the order of operations right.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, writing down the target denotation (namely, `-5`) is easy as pie.  The only thing you really need to think about is the order of operations, which most people are capable of mastering.  So if you're asking only for denotations, rather than semantics, you can get more annotations, faster, cheaper, and more reliably, from ordinary people.\n",

    "We'd like to automate the process of building a semantic parsing model as much as possible.  Ideally, we'd start from training examples annotated with denotations, run one command, and get back a fully-baked semantic parsing model.  This would make it vastly easier to build models for new domains or in new languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weight learning introduced in the previous section brings us one step closer to that goal.  It makes it possible to leverage machine learning, rather than human expertise, in constructing a scoring model for ranking candidate parses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In truth, however, we're still quite far from fully automated model construction.  As things stand, there's one big piece that remains completely manual: grammar engineering.  In the arithmetic domain, we had to write rules that specify that the token `\"one\"` corresponds to the semantic representation `1`, that the token `\"times\"` corresponds to the semantic representation `*`, and so on.  Because the arithmetic domain is simple and the grammar is small, this wasn't especially cumbersome.  But in more realistic domains, grammars can become very large, with thousands of rules.  The burden of manual grammar engineering then becomes a major impediment to rapid progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, a major theme in academic research on semantic parsing (and, indeed, syntactic parsing as well) has been [grammar induction][], which means automatically inducing the rules of the grammar from data.  This is a big topic, one that we will touch on only lightly in SippyCup.\n",

    "One approach to inducing the rules of the grammar, explored in [Zettlemoyer & Collins 2005][], reduces the problem to conventional weight learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- generate all rules possible under certain constraints,\n",
    "- build a linear scoring model with rule features,\n",
    "- use SGD training, as in the previous section, to learn weights for each rule, and then\n",

    "This strategy has usually been applied only to *lexical* rules, with compositional rules still defined manually.  What does it mean to generate all lexical rules possible?  The basic idea is to build rules from pieces that we find in the training examples.  To generate a lexical rule, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- choose the LHS from the set of categories which appear in the compositional rules,\n",
    "- choose the RHS from the set of tokens which appear in the example inputs, and\n",
    "- choose the semantics from the set of fragments which appear in the example semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This generative process is usually constrained in some way, and much depends on the specific constraints.  If we generate too few rules, we are unlikely to find the ones we need for parsing, and we'll see oracle accuracy stuck near zero.  But if we generate too many, our grammar will be very large, parsing will be exceedingly slow, and training will grind to a halt.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of constraining the generative process, suggested in [Liang & Potts 2015][], is to assume that we know the proper syntactic category for each token and each semantic fragment, but not the proper mapping between tokens and semantic fragments within the same syntactic category.  In the arithmetic domain, this would mean knowing that the tokens `'plus'`, `'minus'`, and `'times`, and the semantic fragments `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'*'`, all belong to the syntactic category `$BinOp`, but without knowing that `'plus'` corresponds to `'+'`.\n",
